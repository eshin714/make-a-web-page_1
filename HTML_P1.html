<h1 class="maintitle">PROJECT 1: ALL MY NOTES</h1>
  	<h2 class="title">THE BASICS OF THE WEB AND HTML</h2>
	 	<div class="article">
		    <p>The WORLD WIDE WEB is made up of a collection HTML. You could say its a web of HTML. There are over 30 billion HTML links on the internet.
		    </p>

		    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which can be made up of 4 parts. The first is text content, which is what you see. The second is mark up, which is what it looks like. The third are references, which  other documents such as images and videos. The last is links, which are "links" to other pages.
		    </p>
	 	</div>
  
	<h2 class="title">HTML ATTRIBUTES and TAGS!</h2>
 		<div class="article">
		  	<p>
		     Attributes always equal a value and they can have multiple attributes.
		    <br>
		    <br>I created this tag with a "anchor" tag. This "a" or "anchor" tag enables you to define a <b>hyperlink</b>.
		    for example Here is a <a href = "www.reddit.com">website</a>.
	  		</p>
  
			<p>  
			Here is a <b>image</b> tag.<br>
			"img" tags can embed images into HTML through a type of link.
			  
			Here is an example of an image
			  
			<img src="http://jokideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Funny-cat-meme-Cake.jpg" alt="funny cat picture!" height="200" width="300">
			</p>
			
			<p>  
			Bold Tag - Bolds words within in the tag for example <b> I just bolded this statement with the bold tag </b>
			</p> 
			
			<p>
			Emphasis tag - This tag emphasizes or italicizes for example <em> Whoa, I am cool.</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Span tag - This tag spans two lines into one line.
			  	<br>
			  	ex:
			  	<br>
				<span>this is one line</span>
				Hell yea, one line.
				<br>
				<br>
				Div tag - This tag divides lines.
				<div>This is one line.</div>
				Nope, two lines.
			</p>

	<h1 class="maintitle"> STRUCTURE AND STYLE</h1>
		<h2 class="title">
		HTML's TREE LIKE STRUCTURE
		</h2>
			<div class="article">
				<div>HTML is made up of a "tree" like structure. You can have HTML "branches" or elements inside other HTML "branches" or elements. In other words you can have boxes within boxes within boxes! The DOM or Document Object Model is the the tree like structure that translates the structure.
				</div>
				
		<h3 class="subtitle">TAGS and DOMS</h3>
			
				<div>HTML is the language of the internet. It uses "tags" to decide what it will do with the text being used. The DOM then translates that "tag" and displays it on the page. These "tags" can be MANY things. Each tag can also have attributes with values. These values can change the elements even more.
				</div>
	
		<h3 class="subtitle">HTML and BOXES</h3>

				<div>Everything on a webpage is a BOX. Thinking of things in boxes will help build webpages. It helps rearrange things to give uses a different experience. 
				</div>
			</div>
	




	<h2 class="title">CSS OR CASCADING STYLE SHEETS</h2>
		<div class="article">		
				<div>Cascading style sheets or CSS alls you to use a special syntax and special rules to change the <b>STYLE</b> of the page. CSS will create the look and feel of the page and give it a unique <b>style</b> that will make the page feel original and aesthetically pleasing.
				</div>

	<h3 class="subtitle">INHERITANCE</h3>
			<div>Inheritance involves the HIGHEST to LOWEST level of applications to the style. At the highest level the rule or syntax will apply to the lower, but the syntax or rule at the lowest level will not apply to the ones above it. It relies on the document tree or the hierarchy of the HTML elements. It should be noted that in general, the descendent elements will <em>inherit</em> text related properties, but not box-related properties.
			</div>
	<h3 class="subtitle">AVOID REPETITION</h3>
			<div>The use of CSS can help avoid repeating yourself! With the styles you can "class"-ify titles and headers. You can also set colors and fonts for similar sections as you see fit. With CSS its easy to avoid repetition and be more efficient with time and adding more code which could mean more errors. It also helps your code become more readable. If you're consistent in your code people can fix and change things accordingly and efficiently. It also helps when you're able to see where you have made mistakes without all the repetition cluttering your code. With CSS you can create new sections, titles, change background colors, fonts, and many other things!</div>

			<div>As Programmers and Coders we should avoid repetition!</div>
